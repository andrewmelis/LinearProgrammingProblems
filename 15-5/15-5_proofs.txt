Chvatal problem 15.5, pg 238
================================================================================================

A row r of the payoff matrix is said to dominate a row s if a[rj] >= a[sj] for all j = 1,2,...,n.
Similarly, a column r of the payoff matrix is said to dominate a column s if a[ir] >= a[is] 
for all i = 1,2,....,m. Prove:

  (i)  If a row r is dominated by another row, then the row player has at least one optimal
       strategy x* in which x[r]* = 0. In particular, if row r is deleted from the payoff matrix,
       then the value of the game does not change.

  (ii) If a column r is dominated by another column, then the column player has at least one optimal
       strategy y* in which y[s]* = 0. In particular, if column s is deleted from the payoff matrix,
       then the value of the game does not change.
       
************


Proof of part (i):

Assume that row r is dominated by row s. Thus, the row player can achieve, with pure strategy s,
a payoff >= the payoff possible by pure strategy r regardless of the column player's choice.

As stated in the given, if a row r is dominated by another row, then the row player has at least one
optimal strategy x* in which x[r]* = 0. 


Case 1:
  
  In the case where row r is weakly dominated, ie, a[rj] <= a[sj] for all j = 1,2,...,n,
  Some optimal mixed strategies may have used the dominated row in some percentage
  of cases. Removal of row r would eliminate those mixed strategies utilizing row r
  from the set of optimal strategies for the row player.

  By definition, all optimal mixed strategies produce the same value v for the row player.
  If a mixed strategy does not produce that value v (ie, the value of the game), then that 
  strategy is not optimal.

  So, these possible optimal strategies using row r are eliminated from the set of 
  available optimal strategies. The remaining optimal strategy/strategies all should have
  the same value v for the row player. Thus, the value v of the game does not change.

  However, suppose, for contradiction, that the value of the game DOES change when 
  row r is deleted from the payoff matrix. 
  
  If the value v increases increases after row r is eliminated, then this contradicts
  the assumption the strategies removed were optimal strategies.

  If the value v decreases after row r is eliminated, then this means contradicts the
  assumption that at least one strategy x* exists in which x[r]* = 0 and that some 
  strategy s produced a payoff larger than the payoff produced by row r for all j.

  This is a contradiction because any value of x[r]* greater than zero would alter
  the calculation of x* = x[1]* + x[2]* + ... x[m]*.


  Case 1 proved, by contradiction.


Case 2:
  
  In the case where row r is strictly dominated, ie, a[rj] < a[sj] for all j = 1,2,...,n,
  no mixed optimal strategies "play" row r, ie, every optimal strategy x* has x[r]*=0.

  If removal of row r eliminated some mixed strategies from the set of optimal strategies,
  this would contradict the assumption that row r is strictly dominated by some other row s,
  as a strictly dominated row is used in exactly zero optimal strategies.

  Suppose, for contradiction, that the value of the game DOES change when row r is deleted
  from the payoff matrix.

  If the value v increases increases after row r is eliminated, then this contradicts
  the assumption that the previous value / optimal strategies were determined properly.

  If the value v decreases after row r is eliminated, then this means contradicts the
  assumption that at least one strategy x* exists in which x[r]* = 0 and that some 
  strategy s produced a payoff larger than the payoff produced by row r for all j.
  
  This is a contradiction because any value of x[r]* greater than zero would alter
  the calculation of x* = x[1]* + x[2]* + ... x[m]*.

  Case 2 proved, by contradiction.
  
Proof of part (i), by cases, complete.


****

Proof of part (ii) is as in part (i), above, but replace all occurrences of "row" with "column";
"x*" with "y*"; "r" with "s"; and "s" with "t"
