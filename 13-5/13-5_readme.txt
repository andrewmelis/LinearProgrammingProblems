Note on Chvatal 13.5
=========================

I implemented this solution in Ruby.

To run, type 'ruby 13-5_test.rb' in the command line
after installing Ruby.

Unfortunately, my Ruby implementation only works on inputs
in ascending order. While not ideal for an algorithm, the 
Ruby implementation can sort the inputs prior to running
the algorithm without severe loss of speed.
